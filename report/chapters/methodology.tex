\chapter{Methodology}

% - Does the growth reach a steady state? (at t=1200)
% - Will the rate of growth reach a steady state or will the number increase as you keep increasing the size of the grid?
% - What will happen if the value of M is changed - pick two values on either side of the value given.
% - Comment on computational complexity of each method. (note you had been asked to locate common-points which both methods reach)
