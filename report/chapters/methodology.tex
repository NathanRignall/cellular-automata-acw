\section{Task1}

The random movement of cells must be modelled using a probability distribution.


There are several probability distributions that can be classified as discrete or continuous, we will analyse uniform, bernoulli and beta.

The uniform distribution is usually regarded as a continuous distribution but can also be used to model discrete variables. 

Area under the graph is one.ss

\[ f(x) =\begin{cases}a & \text{if } x = 1\\b & \text{if } x = 0\end{cases}\]

\[ f(x) =\begin{cases}1 & \text{for } 0  \leq x  \leq  1\\0 & \text{otherwise}\end{cases}\]

\[ \frac{dN}{dt}  = kNln\left(\frac{M}{n} \right) \]
