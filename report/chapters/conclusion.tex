\chapter{Conclusion}

This report successfully implemented a simulation of the growth of cancer cells in a tissue using computational techniques.
The model's complexity is of $\bigO(n) + \bigO(n) = \bigO(n)$, where $n$ is the number of steps in the simulation.

The euler method was used 

No iteration between movement and growth
Bernoulli distribution for movement based on surface tension
And leaky boundary conditions

% Also talk about edge processing and limited requirements
% Issues with the numerical strategy include the accuracy of the simulation and the computation time.
