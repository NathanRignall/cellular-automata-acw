\chapter{Conclusion}

This report successfully implemented a simulation of the growth of cancer cells in a tissue using computational techniques.
The model's complexity is of $\bigO(n) + \bigO(n) = \bigO(n)$, where $n$ is the number of steps in the simulation.

% The euler method was used 

Currently the model has no interaction between movement and growth.
A Bernoulli distribution for movement based on surface tension and leaky boundary conditions could be implemented to simulate the growth of cancer cells more accurately.

% Also talk about edge processing and limited requirements
% Issues with the numerical strategy include the accuracy of the simulation and the computation time.
